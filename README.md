# Robot-reaches-destination-game
a game where user will start from 0,0 position (you see R) and will try to reach to the destination 10,10 position You see D). A robot will go up, down, left right by inputting U, D, L or R for 15 times. In the middle of the roads there are some bombs  (we put -1 for bombs).  There are also some walls (we put number 5 for walls). Robot has to go side by the walls. If the robot reaches the bombs – game over. Otherwise, if all 15 steps are done before reaching destination, game over. If robot reaches destination – user wins.
